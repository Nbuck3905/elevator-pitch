My name is Nathan
Graduated from  Sevenlakes High school in 2018.  Went to lonestar college for a one year and didnt like how the system was. Ive been involved with computers all of my life, I built my first pc when I was 12 years old. I just recently fell in love with coding around a year ago, my roomates introduced me to it and I thought it was so interesting. I began to play with code little by little and I knew that I had to take the Flat Iron bootcamp, and im so glad that I did. I want to be a software engineer mainly because I like to challenge my self and with coding and taking this course I am pushing my self to the limit everyday. My first exposure to coding was with sneaker and supreme bots, they are automated softwares that checkout for you on shopify, supreme, SNKRS and etc... I was very curious about the bots and how they work, I knew that one day I want to make my own.
